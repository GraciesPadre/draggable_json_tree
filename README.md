# draggable_json_tree

I built this using CentOS 7 using the Qt 5 development package gotten with yum install.
To build, you'll need Cmake 3.10 or later.  You can either build by using Cmake directly
or follow the past of least resistance and get CLion, which comes with a 30-day evaluation license.
